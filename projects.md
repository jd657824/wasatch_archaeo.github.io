    <h1>Projects</h1>
    
    <p>
        This page provides an overview of ongoing and upcoming research initiatives, manuscripts in progress, and opportunities for collaboration. Below you will find details of work near publication, current funding and grant-supported projects, and ideas for future collaborative research.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Manuscripts in Publication</h2>
    <p>
        Below are select manuscripts currently under review or in the final stages of publication. Each project contributes to a deeper understanding of human-environment relationships and adaptive strategies:

            <br><em>Target Submission Date:</em> March 2025
            <br><em>Description:</em> This research compares the nutritional profiles of introduced maize agriculture with endemic North American geophytes to understand dietary transitions and adaptations among indigenous populations.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Funded Projects &amp; Ongoing Grants</h2>
    <p>
        These projects are currently supported by external funding or are part of ongoing grants. They demonstrate the recognition and support of the academic community for innovative research in human-environment interactions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grant Project Title 1:</strong> Description of funded project; include the grant agency and objectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Grant Project Title 2:</strong> Description of funded project; include the grant agency and objectives.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Research in Development &amp; Collaboration Opportunities</h2>
