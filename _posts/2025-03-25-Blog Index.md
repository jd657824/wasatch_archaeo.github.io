## 1. **Two-Eyed Seeing, Posted 2-28-25**
**Title:** *Integrating Indigenous and Western Knowledge Systems*

**Highlights:**
- Presents the concept of _Etuaptmumk_ (“Two-Eyed Seeing”), introduced by Mi’kmaw Elder Albert Marshall, as a guiding framework.
- Encourages viewing the world through **two distinct yet complementary lenses**—Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Western science.
- Shows how bridging these perspectives leads to deeper insights, collaborative research approaches, and more inclusive stewardship practices.
- Emphasizes **mutual respect** and **dynamic integration**, rather than blending knowledge systems into a single, uniform perspective.

## 2. **Cultural-Ecological Disconnect**
**Title:** *Understanding How We Became Separated from Our Natural Context*

**Highlights:**
- Defines the “cultural-ecological disconnect” and traces its roots in industrialization and colonial expansion.  
- Examines impacts like resource overexploitation, reduced adaptive capacity, and erosion of Indigenous knowledge systems.  
- Explores how bridging TEK with scientific frameworks fosters reconnection and resilience.

## 3. **Bronfenbrenner’s Bioecological Model**
**Title:** *Understanding Human Development Through the PPCT Lens*

**Highlights:**
- Introduces Urie Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological model, highlighting the **Process-Person-Context-Time (PPCT)** framework.
- Explains how **microsystems, mesosystems, exosystems, and macrosystems** shape individual growth within an ecological context.
- Emphasizes **process** (reciprocal interactions), **person** (individual characteristics), **context** (environmental layers), and **time** (temporal shifts) as interconnected factors.
- Draws parallels to environmental anthropology, illustrating how social structures and personal experiences are nested within broader ecological and cultural systems.

## 4. **Julian Steward and Karl Butzer**
**Title:** *Where Cultural Ecology Meets Archaeology as Human Ecology*

**Highlights:**
- Compares Steward’s cultural ecology (multilinear evolution) with Butzer’s “archaeology as human ecology.”  
- Discusses Butzer’s five critical dynamics (environment, technology, economy, social organization, ideology).  
- Highlights environment-culture feedback loops and the importance of holistic, long-term perspectives.

## 5. **Behavioral Ecology**
**Title:** *Understanding How Organisms Adapt Their Behaviors to Environmental Challenges*

**Highlights:**
- Explores cost-benefit analyses in foraging, mate selection, and social dynamics.  
- Details inclusive fitness, evolutionary stable strategies (ESS), and how these shape populations.  
- Links to human behavioral ecology in subsistence and social structures.

---

## 6. **Optimal Foraging Theory**
**Title:** *Understanding How Organisms Maximize Energy Gain in Their Environments*

**Highlights:**
- Introduces key concepts: energy maximization, search/handling times, Marginal Value Theorem.  
- Applications in archaeology (diet reconstruction, settlement patterns) and ecology (animal foraging).  
- Addresses critiques involving social, cultural, and spiritual factors in resource decisions.

## 7. **Niche Construction Theory**
**Title:** *How Organisms Actively Shape Their Environments*

**Highlights:**
- Positions evolution as a two-way street: species adapt to environments while also modifying them.  
- Discusses examples from beavers to ancient agriculturalists, showing ecosystem engineering.  
- Examines cultural dimensions of human-driven niche construction and implications for sustainability.

## 8. **Climatic Stationarity**
**Title:** *Why the Past Is (Mostly) No Longer a Reliable Guide*

**Highlights:**
- Explains the end of stationarity under climate change, with shifting extremes and feedback loops.  
- Looks at water management impacts and planning challenges.  
- Encourages adaptive strategies, real-time data collection, and scenario-based approaches.

## 9. **Topographic Regionalization**
**Title:** *How Landscapes Shape Cultural-Ecological Patterns*

**Highlights:**
- Defines topographic regionalization—dividing areas based on landforms and geomorphology.  
- Illustrates how altitude, slope, and orientation influence microclimates and biodiversity.  
- Features southwestern Wyoming as an example, showcasing mountain-valley environmental gradients.

## 10. **Floral and Faunal Refugia**
**Title:** *Where Biodiversity Finds Shelter in Changing Climates*

**Highlights:**
- Introduces refugia as local havens sustaining species during climatic upheavals.  
- Offers examples (glacial refugia, montane forests, riparian corridors) and modern conservation needs.  
- Argues for targeted protection and corridor connectivity to preserve biodiversity.

## 11. **Cultural-Ecological Disconnect and Maize**
**Title:** *When a Promising Resource Becomes an Incompatible Prey*

**Highlights:**
- Focuses on the Basin-Plateau region, analyzing how maize agriculture clashed with arid environments.  
- Tracks how initial benefits eventually gave way to ecological mismatches.  
- Draws parallels to modern monocultures reliant on fragile, water-intensive systems.

## 12. **Southwestern Wyoming’s Ecological Mosaic**
**Title:** *Uniting Climatic Drivers, Stationarity, Topographic Regionalization, and Refugia*

**Highlights:**
- Explains how late Holocene conditions underlie today’s semi-arid to montane ecosystems.  
- Details ENSO influences, partial stationarity, and dramatic topographic variations.  
- Emphasizes the role of refugia and integrated land management for long-term resilience.
