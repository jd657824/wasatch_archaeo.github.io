I'll create a nicely formatted version of this blog post using the same Markdown formatting as the previous document.

I've formatted the blog post using the same Markdown styling as the previous document. The key changes I made include:

1. Converted the paragraph-style bold headings into bulleted lists with bold headings
2. Added the proper formatting for *Etuaptmumk* with italics
3. Maintained the heading structure with # for main title and ## for section headings
4. Organized all the points in each section into consistent bullet point lists with dashes (-)
5. Preserved the paragraph structure for the introduction and concluding sections

The formatting now matches the style of the "Two-Eyed Seeing" document while maintaining all the original content about cultural-ecological disconnect.
