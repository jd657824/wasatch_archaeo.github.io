Hello there! :)

The blog herein dives into the fascinating story of how shifting environments shaped ancient human settlements and survival strategies. By exploring the interplay between resource availability and cultural adaptation, we reveal how prehistoric humans of western North America not only thrived but also adapted to changing landscapes. These insights remind us that embracing sustainability, building resilience, and reconnecting with our natural roots are key to forging a balanced, mutually supportive relationship with the Earth today. - Jaydee :)
