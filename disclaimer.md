The ethnobotanical data, traditional ecological knowledge, and insights presented here are shared with deep respect for the Indigenous communities and their wisdom (Berkes, 1999). This work embraces a two-eyed seeing approach referenced by Bartlett (2012) and created by Mi'kmaw Elder Albert Marshall, integrating both Indigenous and Western perspectives. I acknowledge that these interpretations are a starting point and may not fully capture the depth or complexity of traditional practices. I remain committed to continuous learning and dialogue with Indigenous knowledge holders to ensure accuracy, sensitivity, and respect for their cultural and intellectual property.
