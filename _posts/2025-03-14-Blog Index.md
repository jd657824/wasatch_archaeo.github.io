2. Optimal Foraging Theory

Title: Understanding How Organisms Maximize Energy Gain in Their Environments
Highlights:
	•	Introduces key concepts: energy maximization, search/handling times, and the Marginal Value Theorem.
	•	Applications in archaeology (diet reconstruction, settlement patterns) and ecology (animal foraging behavior).
	•	Addresses critiques involving social, cultural, and spiritual influences on resource decisions.

4. Behavioral Ecology

Title: Understanding How Organisms Adapt Their Behaviors to Environmental Challenges
Highlights:
	•	Explores cost-benefit analyses in foraging, mate selection, and social structures.

5. Niche Construction Theory

Title: How Organisms Actively Shape Their Environments
Highlights:
	•	Reframes evolution as a two-way street: species not only adapt but also modify habitats.
	•	Examples span from beaver dams to ancient agricultural terraces, highlighting ecosystem engineering.
	•	Discusses cultural dimensions of human niche construction and implications for sustainability.

6. Cultural-Ecological Disconnect and Maize

Title: When a Promising Resource Becomes an Incompatible Prey
Highlights:
	•	Examines how maize agriculture clashed with arid conditions in the Basin-Plateau region.
	•	Shows how prehistoric groups temporarily benefited from farming before facing long-term mismatches.
	•	Parallels drawn to modern monocultures reliant on fragile, water-intensive systems.

7. Climatic Stationarity

Title: Why the Past Is (Mostly) No Longer a Reliable Guide
Highlights:
	•	Outlines the demise of stationarity in light of climate change, increasing extremes, and feedback loops.
	•	Explores ramifications for water management, infrastructure planning, and conservation.
	•	Encourages adaptive strategies, real-time monitoring, and flexible scenario planning.

8. Topographic Regionalization

Title: How Landscapes Shape Cultural-Ecological Patterns
Highlights:
	•	Defines the practice of classifying areas based on landforms—mountain ridges, plateaus, basins.
	•	Shows how altitude, slope, and geomorphology influence microclimates and biotic communities.
	•	Illustrates southwestern Wyoming as a case study, emphasizing mountain-valley transitions.

9. Floral and Faunal Refugia

Title: Where Biodiversity Finds Shelter in Changing Climates
Highlights:
	•	Introduces refugia as critical havens preserving species through climatic upheavals (e.g., glacial events).
	•	Spotlights examples like montane forests, desert springs, and riparian corridors.
	•	Advocates for targeted conservation measures to maintain and connect these ecological strongholds.

10. Southwestern Wyoming’s Ecological Mosaic

Title: Uniting Climatic Drivers, Stationarity, Topographic Regionalization, and Refugia
Highlights:
	•	Synthesizes how Late Holocene conditions laid the groundwork for present-day semi-arid to montane ecosystems.
	•	Details the role of ENSO and partial stationarity in shaping precipitation patterns.
	•	Underscores adaptive significance of refugia and the importance of integrated land-use strategies.

11. Julian Steward and Karl Butzer

Title: Where Cultural Ecology Meets Archaeology as Human Ecology
Highlights:
	•	Juxtaposes Steward’s focus on cultural ecology and multilinear evolution with Butzer’s “archaeology as human ecology.”
	•	Covers Butzer’s five critical dynamics (environment, technology, economy, social organization, and ideology).
	•	Demonstrates how each framework underscores environment-culture feedback loops and long-term resilience.
